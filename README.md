# Recommendation-Project
A recommendation engine is basically a type of data filtering tool using machine learning algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to a particular user or customer. These Recommendation Algorithms are commonly used by various OTT platforms and music apps and many other such apps to increase interactivity with the users. There are popularly 3 types of recommendation engines:
1. Content Based Recommendation System
2. Popularity Based Recommendation System
3. Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendation System

Through this project, I have demonstrated how a content based recommendation engine recommends relevant items to user

# Getting Started
Start by downloading or cloning the project and run 'Content Based Movie Recommendation.ipynb' file in ipython notebook (jupyter notebook)
To clone the code follow the command:
-      üëâüèª git clone https://github.com/Shraddha-Garg/movie-nation-recommendation.git

# Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries before running this project.
	1.  python version (3.10)
	2.  PyAudio version (0.2.11)
	3.  Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, numpy
	4.  Streamlit: pip install streamlit
	5.  Streamlit_Lottie: pip install streamlit_lottie
	6.  similarity.pkl: download this file through the link --->  "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V37It9DJXF-9MR9UrBu4dJxMPL46n9DQ/view?usp=sharing" and after downloading copy it to the location where all other cloned files are extracted

# Steps to Run Code
-      üëâüèª git clone https://github.com/Shraddha-Garg/movie-nation-recommendation.git
-      üëâüèª Open file app.py with VS Code. Then in the terminal install the following requirements:
-      üëâüèª pip install pipwin
-      üëâüèª pipwin install pyaudio
-      üëâüèª python -m pip install --upgrade pip
-      üëâüèª python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
-      üëâüèª pip install streamlit
-      üëâüèª pip install streamlit_lottie
-      üëâüèª Now download similarity.pkl file through the link --> "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V37It9DJXF-9MR9UrBu4dJxMPL46n9DQ/view?usp=sharing" for code to execute and after downloading copy it to the location where all other cloned files are extracted
-      üëâüèª streamlit run app.py

# Built With
	1. ipython-notebook:  Python Text Editor (Jupyter Notebook) to load and pre-process data
	2. sklearn:  Machine Learning Library
	3. difflib:  Comparing Sequences (here, movie title input by the user from the titles available from imported database)
	4. pickle:  serializing and de-serializing python object structures. The process to converts any kind of python objects (list, dict, etc.) into byte streams (0s and 1s) is called pickling whereas converting the byte stream (generated through pickling) back into python objects by a process called as unpickling.
	5. numpy:  Number Python Library
	6. pandas:  Data Handling Library
	7. streamlit:  Used for making recommendation system models
	8. streamlit_lottie:  Used for adding animated content in web based applications
	9. tmdb API:  To get back corresponding movie posters by giving movie id's from databases as arguments
